# Variables

## Integer

The standard `int` in C++ takes up 4 bytes or 32 bits of memory.

An `int` can be positive or negative. One of the bits is reserved for `sign` the rest of the bits are for magnitude.

we can get the magnitude by doing the following:

$2^{32-1} = 2^{31} = 2,147,483,648$

Since this can be either positive or negative the total range is:

-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
